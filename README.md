# Real and Fake News Classification 

- Challenge was to train a model from train data and test in test dataset whether a news article is real or fake and get the accuracy in 90-92% correct bracket.

- The data contained to columns 'Title' and the 'Content' 

- 2 Methods to do this one is the easy one another is the hard one. 

- Combine Title and the content in one column and then predict

- Use Title and content separately and then predict. This method obviously will give better accuracy.
